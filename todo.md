# Next Todo Items

* Get the init updated, i.e. remove the 2.20 for the azurerm terraform init or whatever it's requesting.
* Confirm the database URI is being set properly.
* Finalize the "root" account and draw out diagram for the architecture.
* Finish brainstorming for next UI steps. Diagram and post documentation for that.
* Possibly build cross-platform piece for the control plane.
